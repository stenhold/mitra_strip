# Particle Movement Simulation

This repository contains a Python script for simulating the movement of particles on a paper-chromatography substrate, resembling the flow of a liquid wave. The simulation visualizes particles as they spread across the substrate, controlled by various parameters through a graphical user interface.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the simulation, you need to have Python installed on your machine along with some additional libraries. The code has been tested with Python 3.8 and later.

### Dependencies

- numpy
- matplotlib

You can install these dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib


Installation
To run the simulation, first clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/stenhold/mitra_strip.git
cd mitra_strip
Usage
To start the simulation, run the script from the command line:

bash
Copy code
python simulation.py
Features
The simulation allows you to adjust several parameters to see how they affect particle movement:

Number of Particles
Tail Transparency
Tail Length
Frame Rate
Particle Speed
These parameters can be adjusted through sliders in the graphical user interface.
